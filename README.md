# Healthcare-Data

This is an Executive Dashboard Project that involved data analysis of Hospital Data around the world.
I performed minor data cleaning and the development of new data columns and measures using DAX in order to create the appropriate data for visualization.
Then, I built a dashboard which displays general data figures and more precised data figures about hospital cases that can be changed based on the type of data (Death, Recovered and Confirmed).
